# MKW Lounge Queuebot
For continuity, I have left the [original author](https://github.com/cyndaquilx)'s ReadMe below. This particular fork will have tweaks specifically for Lounge for Mario Kart Wii. This repo should only be downloaded for Mario Kart Wii Lounge use (in case the one I am hosting goes down). If you want the general Queuebot, please visit the [original author's repository](https://github.com/cyndaquilx/QueueBot).

# Cynda's Original ReadMe: QueueBot

This is the bot used in MK8DX 150cc Lounge to run Squad Queue events, where teams of 2, 3, or 4 queue up and are placed into rooms based on their average MMR.

You will need [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing) to run the bot, and [gspread](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if you get your MMR from a spreadsheet.

If you get your MMR from a spreadsheet, make a Google Sheet with sheet name "search" that functions the same as [this sample.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ts17B2k8Hv5wnHB-4kCE3PNFL1EXEJ01lx-s8zPpECE/edit?usp=sharing) Make sure that you have a `credentials.json` file in your bot directory, instructions [here.](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html)

If you don't get your MMR from a spreadsheet, the **mmr** function in `cogs/Sheet.py` will have to be rewritten. The provided file should give you a general idea of how the function should work.

Make sure that you edit `config.json` so that the following fields have a value:
- token: replace "insert token here" with your bot's token
- roles: list containing the roles that should have mogi powers
- mogichannel: ID of the channel where players can join the mogi
- randombot_role: ID of RandomBot's role
- boobot_role: ID of BooBot's role (or whatever you use to get FCs)

Once you have everything set up, run `lounge.py` from the command line
